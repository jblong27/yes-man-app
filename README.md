## Description
An application that will present the user with a questionnaire that narrows down what activities we think the user may be interested in doing next.

If the user doesn’t think we got it right, we have an input box for them to leave their own suggestion along with their email. The user’s suggestion will be stored in our database for us to review and eventually be added to our own suggested activities, so our app can always be growing.
